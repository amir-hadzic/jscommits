# jscommits

This is a simple widget that you can use to pull the latest commits from some
github project. This is still work in progress, but this is how the widget
looks right now:

As you can see the color scheme is shamelessly stolen from github itself.

## Dependencies

 * jQuery
 * Underscore

[Gh3](https://github.com/k33g/gh3) is also required but it's packed with the
minified version. jQuery and Underscore are not packed with the minifed version
of jscommits.
